    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read. I am someone who after graduating High School worked for 11 years at a small realty management company for a landlord in New York City. I was an office clerk handling several office duties such as creating letters for the tenants of the apartments we managed, maintaining different types of records which included tenant non-payment records and building violations that were given to our residential buildings. I also worked for a few months in 2022 as a Spanish Interpreter where I translated many calls in the medical field, insurance agencies, emergency calls, and other areas as well. Currently, I am a new tax preparer and am working with my family in the business they created in 2005. I have learned the basics of filing taxes, using the Drake Software to prepare income tax information for our clients. I have also learned to help our clients fill out other forms they need help with in areas of Immigration and NY State Benefits.</p>
